# Introduction

The developer Net Promoter Score is a metric used in developer experience. 
It measures the support of developers to a company. DNPS scores are calculated with a single question survey and reported with a number from -100 to +100. A higher score is desirable.

# How to implement Developer NPS?

The question posed is, how likely are you to recommend COMPANYNAME as a place where you can become the best engineer you can be?

Respondents give a rating between 0 (not at all likely) and 10 (extremely likely) and, depending on their response, fall into one of 3 categories to establish an NPS score:
- Promoters respond with a score of 9 or 10 and are typically loyal and enthusiastic developers.
- Passives respond with a score of 7 or 8. They are satisfied with their jobs but not happy enough to be considered promoters.
- Detractors respond with a score of 0 to 6. These are unhappy developers who are unlikely to buy from you again and may even discourage others from buying from you.

# Calculating your Developer Net Promoter Score
It's simple to calculate your final NPS score â€“ subtract the percentage of detractors from the percentage of promoters.
For example, if 10% of respondents are detractors, 20% are passives, and 70% are promoters, your NPS score would be 70-10 = 60.
Turning detractors into promoters can impact your NPS and improve loyalty to your brand.


# Epilogue
Regularly doing a Developer Net Promotor Score check, say once a month, will allow you to track your developer's support for the company.
It will allow you to see any trends over time and enable you to take actions to increase support. It is also super simple to implement as it is only one question.
