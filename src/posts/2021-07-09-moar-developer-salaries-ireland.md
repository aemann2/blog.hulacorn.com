# Scatter plot.
From my previous post on salary data, I received several requests to create a scatter plot on the data. 
I am duly obliging. There may be some discrepancies between the salary ranges from the previous post and the graph. The differences are because I remove outliers from the data to remove variability.

- X-axis - salaries expectation
- Y-axis - is the number of years of experience.
- Colours - I broke out the jobs into three different areas,  DevOps(DevOps is not a thing, but I cannot get away from everyone using it), Frontend, and Backend.
- Colour Size - this represents the fact I have multiple people with the same salary expectations and years of experience, the bigger the colour, the more respondents.
