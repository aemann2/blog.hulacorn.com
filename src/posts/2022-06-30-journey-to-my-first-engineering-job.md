## Introduction

I've always been the techie in my family, the person that was called if there was a technical issue because I loved video games and technology. Naturally, when it became time for me to start looking at careers, I knew I wanted to be in the tech space but wasn't sure where. Growing up, I wasn't exposed to much information on tech careers. The big distinction I knew was that computer science involved math, which I wasn't confident in, even though I liked it and was great at it in school. There was IT, which seemed like a catch-all for everyone who wanted to do Tech.
