## Introduction

Creating software is complex, and defining requirements is challenging. In 20 years of working, I have observed that engineers have never been in a place where they have all the requirements to build a product. The folks responsible for defining the requirements struggle to communicate or don't know(not knowing is ok, we are human). Once it is specified, the first question is when will the feature be in production. The end-to-end process is broken.

# Votes.hulacorn.com

It is why many of our ideas on votes.Hulacorn.com are focused on helping engineers have a better time at work. We are running an experiment on this site where folks can vote for their problems. Two of the top three were around requirements gathering, and once you have the requirements, when will you be done?

We received 172 votes across all our ideas in the last three months.

# Results

We decided to narrow our focus more here at Hulacorn to try solving the problem of estimating when the software will be complete and getting better at gathering requirements. Why these two, We see them as being tightly coupled. The theory goes that the higher quality of the requirements, the more predictable it will be to forecast the completion date.

# Epilogue 
We will continue building in public, sharing what we learn.
